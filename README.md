This is an I2C IO expander board that will add 16 pins of IO to a micro controller over I2C.  The IC used allows up to 8 devices on a bus so they can be daisy chained using common RJ11 (telephone) patch cables, allowing a max of 128 pins of IO.  The address is configurable along with terminations and interrupt destinations.
